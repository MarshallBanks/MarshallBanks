At work, I build new internal web apps in C#/.NET (Blazor) and also maintain existing systems.

## Archived Coursework

Older school projects I’m keeping for reference. Most of my professional work is in private repos.

### [Desktop Support Scheduling App](https://github.com/MarshallBanks/C969-Performance-Assessment)
Built a scheduling desktop app with a SQL-backed data layer, including CRUD workflows, validation, and search/filtering.

### [Degree Planner Mobile App](https://github.com/MarshallBanks/C971-Performance-Assessment)
Built an iOS/Android degree planner in Xamarin + SQLite with multi-screen navigation, local persistence, and input validation.

### [Inventory Management App](https://github.com/MarshallBanks/Inventory-System)
Built an inventory manager in C# with part/product CRUD, search, and guardrails for common edge cases (validation + exception handling).

## Currently

**Learning**: Deepening my .NET fundamentals (DI, async, HTTP, performance) and writing more tests.

**Building**: Improving how I structure features end-to-end (UI → API → data) and keeping codebases clean.
